                        As I said, I wanted to deploy the application using the cloud, since that really was something I hadn't do before and it sparked my interest.
                        I did research, wrote <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">Dockerfiles</a> and buildscripts and really liked the full process. I learned a lot about building applications front-to-back and deployments.
                        Now (some months later), I work at a cloud-native company called <a href="https://www.vbridge.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">vBridge</a> and I'm really into cloud-native development and the cloud as a whole (still as a developer, not as devOps or something).

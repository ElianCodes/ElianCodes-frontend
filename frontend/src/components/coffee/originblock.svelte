                        Elian.Coffee was originally an idea that sparked from a school assignment.
                        While I was studying at Odisee University of Applied Sciences, we got an assignment for the subject "Web & Mobile Development".
                        The assignment was about creating a mobile app or PWA in which you had to use a variety of technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-6 max-w-lg mx-auto text-center text-xl text-green-200 sm:max-w-3xl" data-aos="fade-up">
                        Since my first year, I had already made a couple little projects about coffee, since it's one of the things I'm passionate about, and this time I was thinking in the same direction.
                        The original idea was to build a social platform with a focus on sharing where you're drinking your coffee and give them a rating.
                        Think of it as Untappd, but for coffee instead of beer.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-6 max-w-lg mx-auto text-center text-xl text-green-200 sm:max-w-3xl" data-aos="fade-up">
                        When I pitched the idea to my proffessors, they liked the idea, but also told me that they knew someone from the coffee-scene.
                        When they asked if I wanted them to approach him and pitch the idea, I was very enthusiastic and immediatly said yes!
                        Some weeks lated we meeted and talked about what the project could be, Raf had another idea about a platform in which cuppers and coffee manufacterers could organize cuppings (tastings).
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-6 max-w-lg mx-auto text-center text-xl text-green-200 sm:max-w-3xl" data-aos="fade-up">
                        After I took some time to think about the project and how I could realize it, I decided that Raf's project idea actually was a lot better.
                        Not only was it something new and exciting, it also was something usable.
                        Believe me, after making a lot of school projects and deleting them afterwards, it gets frustrating.<br/>
                        So here we go, I started coding the project!

      Software Engineer <a rel="nofollow noopener" class="use-color" href="https://www.vbridge.eu" target="_blank">@vBridge</a> by day 👨‍💻<br />
      Blogger & web enthusiast by night (while also trying to be a good boyfriend 🍷).

      My 💖 for the web was first sparked in 2016 when I decided to build a simple website to display the photo's I took at the time, there was no way back! I'm mainly focused on front-end development, but still a full-stack developer at heart (I just love to fiddle with everything I guess).

      In 2020 I discovered cloud and serverless development, that really peeked my interest further and made me the curious developer I am today.

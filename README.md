# The ElianCodes site

The full sourcecode for my personal website.

(currently) written in [Astro](<https://astro.build>) and [TailwindCSS](<https://tailwindcss.com>) with some [Firebase](<https://firebase.com>) functions as well, deployed to [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com).

*Previous version of this website used [Nuxt](<https://www.nuxtjs.org>), [Vue](<https://www.vuejs.org>) and [TypeScript](<https://www.typescript-lang.com>).*

## Deployment and Hosting

At the moment, this website is hosted on Vercel as a static site and some Firebase functions to use as an API (at buildtime). The DNS is controlled by [CloudFlare](<https://www.cloudflare.com>).

The website was previously hosted on [Google Cloud Storage](<https://cloud.google.com/storage>) as a static folder in a public bucket. Then I transitioned to Firebase, since it was easier to manage, cheaper and you get some handy features like preview deploys and such.

Currently, it's deployed as a static Vercel website using the [Astro Vercel adapter](). Vercel offers some features I love, like analytics, web vitals info, feature and preview deploys.

## Development setup

To install and manage dependencies, I use [PNPM](<https://pnpm.io/>).

```bash
# for development
pnpm dev

# for local preview
pnpm build && pnpm preview
```

## Technologies and packages

The base of the website uses [Astro](<https://astro.build>) to generate and build the (static) site.

### Frontend

At the moment, the UI of the website is built and generated using [Astro](<https://astro.build>). [Astro](<https://astro.build>) is an amazing technology to generate static sites (but also supports SSR). If you want to know more about it, feel free to read [their documentation](<https://docs.astro.build/getting-started>).

#### Components

Most of my templates are written in pure Astro with some TypeScript features, since I don't need to much interactivity. Components that do require interactivity, are mostly written (ore being converted) to [SolidJS](). Actually, Astro doesn't care in which language you write or define your components. That's kinda their thing.

#### TailwindCSS

To define the style of the website, [TailwindCSS](<https://tailwindcss.com>) is used with [Sass preprocessor](<https://sass-lang.com/>). This allows you to create custom and reusable components with easy by using `@apply` classes. Astro supports this with their amazing [Tailwind integration]().

### Backend

The *real* RESTful API was discontinued on 02 May 2022 since I decided to go with serveless cloud functions on Firebase instead of a running container.

The functions are located in the `functions/` folder in this repo. Most of them are only fetched and used at build time (Yay Astro ðŸ™Œ). For example, the events list, these are fetched from the API at buildtime, the API itself gets them from Firestore.

title: "Between clouds & Stars: Fun with Astro & Google Cloud"
abstract: "In this talk we’ll go a a little deeper in exploring the atmosphere from back- to front-end. We’ll take a look at developing web applications without a backend, but using cloud native solutions (like Cloud Functions ect.), containerising your applications and deploying them using pipelines. Of course we also take a look at scalability & autoscaling."

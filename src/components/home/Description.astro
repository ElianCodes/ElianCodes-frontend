		<p class="poppins">
			Hi, Iâ€™m Elian, software engineer located in Belgium, currently working as
			DX-support at <a
				href="https://astro.build"
				class="underline"
				target="_blank">Astro</a
			>. My love for the web was first sparked in 2018 when I decided to build a
			simple HTML page to display the photos I took at the time, there was no
			way back! Since then and there, I was completely in love with building on
			and for the web. I transitioned to a Wordpress drag-and-drop to then
			learning JavaScript and JAMStack development.
		</p>
		<p class="poppins mt-2">
			Today, I'm mainly focussed on Full-Stack development with a love for
			front-end and JavaScript.
		</p>
		<p class="poppins mt-2">
			I started out as a front-end engineering intern in 2020 at <a
				href="https://www.vbridge.eu/"
				target="_blank"
				class="underline"
				title="To the vBridge website">vBridge</a
			>, where I also started getting into JavaScript frameworks. Next to
			engineering, I'm writing technical documentation & <a href="/events"
				>giving talks and workshops</a
			> about Astro.

    <p class='outfit'>
      My ðŸ’– for the web was first sparked in 2016 when I decided to ðŸ”¨ a simple
      HTML page to display the photo's I took at the time, there was no way
      back! Today, I'm mainly focussed on Full-Stack development with a love for
      front-end and JavaScript

      Elian is a Software Engineer @vBridge where he started a couple years ago
      as an intern. He has a strong focus on design, front-end development and
      cloud native web-applications with the emphasis on personalisation and
      technical innovation. Elian started out building static websites to
      showcase the photos he took, then discovered JAMStack development, since
      then he's always learning and trying out new stuff. Experimentation drew
      him to Astro, there was no way back. Now, Elian is an Astro Ambassador &
      always available for a chat or drink.

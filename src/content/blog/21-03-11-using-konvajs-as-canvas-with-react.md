# Using KonvaJS as canvas with React

While running my internship at [vBridge](https://www.vbridge.eu) I'm working on a front-end based project, building a usable interface for users and needed a HTML canvas for that. Of course I couldn't just use any kind of canvas or a normal HTML canvas. I needed to render different shapes or colors based on the specific situation the user is encountering. The project uses React to begin with. So the search for a usable canvas package with React started.

## Packages that I found

While doing some research I came across some packages that all could have been a valid choice. The packages that stood out the most to me were:

- [Konva](https://konvajs.org)
- [GoJS](https://gojs.net)
- [React art](https://github.com/reactjs/react-art)
- [React Canvas](https://github.com/Flipboard/react-canvas)

Of course there's also the standard HTML canvas which you can read more about [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)

There are probably a lot more available, but these are the ones that I found the most documentation of. Why I chose Kova, you can read below.

## Why use Konva

So I went with Konva. Basically it would be easier to explain why I didn't went with the other ones. I chose not to use React Art because it isn't reactive and that is ofcourse one of the main aspects I'll be needing. React canvas would have been a valid choice as well. It allows you to draw DOM-like elements on the canvas, but is not as easy to draw graphics, that's where Konva and GoJS come in. Both are about drawing graphics in a performant way on the canvas. Konva integrates very easy with React since it has a specific React package called [react-konva](https://konvajs.org/docs/react/index.html). Also, GoJS is not free-to-use in a production environment, so if I were to use GoJS, I had to explain to superiors why I needed to spend money. Since the differences are small, I chose Konva. There you have it.

## Differences between KonvaJS and react-konva

So what's the difference between the 'normal' Konva and react-konva packages. Well basically you can use Konva components in react-konva like so:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import Konva, { Stage, Layer, Text, Rect, Circle } from "react-konva";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Stage>
      <Layer>
        <Text text="hello from Konva" />
        <Rect fill="red" height="50" width="50" />
        <Circle fill="red" radius="60" />
      </Layer>
    </Stage>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Where this would translate in pure KonvaJS without react as follows

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="container"></div>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/konva@7.0.3/konva.min.js"></script>
    <script>
      // first we need to create a stage
      var stage = new Konva.Stage({
        container: "container", // id of container <div>
        width: 500,
        height: 500,
      });

      // then create layer
      var layer = new Konva.Layer();

      // create our shape
      var circle = new Konva.Circle({
        x: stage.width() / 2,
        y: stage.height() / 2,
        radius: 50,
        fill: "red",
      });

      // add the shape to the layer
      layer.add(circle);

      // add the layer to the stage
      stage.add(layer);

      // draw the image
      layer.draw();
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

code example from [kanvajs.org](https://konvajs.org/docs/overview.html)

Ofcourse the React version is way easier! Konva also offers a lot of other features like:

- Exporting to image
- exporting all elements to SVG
- events

## events in konva

```jsx
import React from "react";
import Konva, { Stage, Layer, Circle } from "react-konva";

const App = () => {
  const sayHello = () => {
    console.log("hello");
  };
  return (
    <Stage>
      <Layer>
        <Circle fill="red" radius="60" onMouseOver={sayHello} />
      </Layer>
    </Stage>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Easy right. This wil trigger the `sayHello` method everytime you hover over it. Ofcourse there are lots of other events and triggers available. Feel free to read about the on [the Konva docs](https://konvajs.org/docs/react/index.html).

There are also a lot of Demo's available for Konva and react-konva. See them [here](https://konvajs.org/docs/sandbox/index.html)

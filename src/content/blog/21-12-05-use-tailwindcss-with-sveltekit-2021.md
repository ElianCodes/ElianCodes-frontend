# Use TailwindCSS with Sveltekit (2021)

Since my previous blogpost on using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (JIT) with [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), a lot has changed. That's why I've updated the article to a newer (and better) method.

## Setting up Sveltekit

Setting up a new Sveltekit project is not that hard anymore. Just run the following set of commands:

```bash
npm init svelte@next tailwind-sveltekit-app
```

You can always search [the official documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs) for more info

### Adding an adapter

In most cases, I tend to use Sveltekit as a static site generator. To tell Sveltekit to create static pages, add the static-adapter with following command:

```bash
npm i @sveltejs/adapter-static@next
```

Also add the following to the `svelte.config.cjs`

```js
const adapter = require("@sveltejs/adapter-static");

module.exports = {
  kit: {
    adapter: adapter({
      pages: "build",
      assets: "build",
      fallback: null,
    }),
  },
};
```

This tells Sveltekit to put the output in the `build` folder and dont use a fallback (so generate a `index.html`, `404.html`, `contact.html`, ...)

more info on the adapter [here](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters-supported-environments-static-sites)

## Adding TailwindCSS

Previously I described some additional steps to install Tailwind, like installing autoprefixer and PostCSS. I also setup some extra NPM scripts.

Since TailwindCSS is used a lot across the web these days, it got way easier. Just use the following command:

```bash
npx svelte-add@latest tailwindcss
```

This will install TailwindCSS, PostCSS and other dependencies. It will also add the configuration and a basic `app.css` file with Tailwind imported.

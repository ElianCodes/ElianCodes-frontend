# Using TailwindCSS with Sveltekit

_This post is very outdated, check [the new post](https://www.elian.codes/blog/21-12-05-use-tailwindcss-with-sveltekit-2021/) for an updated version_

Earlier this week, Sveltekit beta got released (read all about it [here](https://svelte.dev/blog/sveltekit-beta)). Since it's so new, I wanted to try out some stuff, including using it with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com). That seemed a little bit more complex than I initially thought.

## What is Sveltekit

Sveltekit is very comparable to [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org) and [Next](https://nextjs.org), but with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). It provides server-side rendering, routing and code-splitting. Also, Sveltekit uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) right out of the box, which makes it incredibly fast.

## Bootstrap Sveltekit

To start a new project is actually very easy with Sveltekit. Just run the following commands in an empty directory:

```bash
npm init svelte@next
```

Then, install your dependencies using `yarn` or `npm install`. For the rest of this post I'll use yarn, but use NPM if you like.

To start up the project using Vite, run the `dev` command

```bash
yarn dev
```

Now your newly bootstrapped Svelte app should be running on `https://localhost:3000`

## Install TailwindCSS

Since Sveltekit is so new, we currently have to use a little workaround to use TailwindCSS, but I imagine that they'll introduce PostCSS support in the 1.0 release of Sveltekit. We'll use the `postcss-cli` package to trigger a build of our PostCSS configuration before we run a build command, which works fine, but you'll need to rebuild Tailwind every time into a static CSS file which can take up some time.

So, let's install TailwindCSS and PostCSS

```bash
yarn add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer postcss-cli
```

Following that, we can create a TailwindCSS configuration file using:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```

Now create a `tailwind.css` file in `src/assets/css/` and add the following content:

```css
@import "tailwindcss/base";
@import "tailwindcss/components";
@import "tailwindcss/utilities";
```

This will tell PostCSS what utilities you're using.

## Configure PostCSS

Now that we have installed TailwindCSS, we just need to configure Svelte to actually use it. To do that, create a file called `postcss.config.cjs` in the root of your project and tell it to use `autoprefixer` and `tailwindcss` to process CSS files:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [require("autoprefixer"), require("tailwindcss")],
};
```

Now we can add a new script to our `package.json`, so it builds TailwindCSS before the main build:

```json
"scripts": {
    "dev": "svelte-kit dev",
    "build": "yarn build:tailwind && svelte-kit build",
    "build:tailwind": "postcss ./src/assets/css/tailwind.css -o static/assets/css/tailwindoutput.css",
    "start": "svelte-kit start",
},
```

Here we configure a script that will run when `yarn build:tailwind` or `yarn build` is triggered. The script will compile tailwind from the local `/src/assets/css/tailwind.css` and add it to the static folder (`/static/assets/css/tailwindoutput.css`) where we'll be able to use it.

Now we can include the file globally by adding the output CSS file as a stylesheet in the `/src/app.html` file.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <link href="../assets/css/tailwindoutput.css" type="text/css" />
    %svelte.head%
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="svelte">%svelte.body%</div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now when you've ran `yarn build:tailwind` once, TailwindCSS should work in your markup!

Don't forget to include the generated TailwindCSS output file to your `.gitignore` if you're using git.

### Add @tailwindcss/jit

To save some more time in the compilation and configuration of TailwindCSS, we can use the `@tailwindcss/jit` package. I dedicated a [whole blogpost about that](https://www.elian.codes/blog/21-03-18-add-tailwind-jit-to-your-nuxtjs-site/), so read it if you're interested and would like to learn more about that.

It's actually easy and I recommend that you use it!

Install the package

```bash
yarn add -D @tailwindcss/jit
```

Tell PostCSS to switch packages by changing `require('tailwindcss')` to `require('@tailwindcss/jit')` in `postcss.config.cjs`

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [require("autoprefixer"), require("@tailwindcss/jit")],
};
```

That should do it!

# Astro + PandaCSS startkit

A couple of days ago, I gave a talk together with Sybren ([@carwack](https://twitter.com/carwack)) about using [PandaCSS](https://panda-css.com/) with [Astro](https://astro.build/) at Fronteers in Ghent. Sybren asked me to join him as a co-host on his talk, mainly about PandaCSS, but combining it with Astro. I had never used PandaCSS before, so the talk was a super interesting for me too!

Walking through the setup of Panda in Astro, I realised there was no real starting template yet. So I put one together for everyone that wants to use it!

Here’s the template: [@eliancodes/pandacss-astro-startkit](https://github.com/ElianCodes/pandacss-astro-startkit).

It’s a little bit opinionated, but I feel like that’s always the case when using design systems / CSS frameworks. I kept it small enough so you can easily adjust it to your own preferences and start building from it!

excited to see what you’ll build!

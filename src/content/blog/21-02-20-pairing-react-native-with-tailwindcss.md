# Pairing React Native with TailwindCSS

For my web & mobile development course @[Odisee](https://odisee.be/en) I had to make a mobile app with technologies of my choice. Ofcourse, I made the choice to use [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) since it's very popular, has good documentation and is a good skill to have (and also available with Typescript). I also wanted to be able to use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), since I'm pretty proficient at it right now, and is very easy to get started with. For the back-end of the application, I made the choice to use [Deno](https://deno.land), but that isn't important right now.

So I went on the search for a easy template to start with (for faster development and results, not because I'm lazy ðŸ˜‰), but I couldn't find any. It seems that React Native doesn't integrate easy with Tailwind, but there exists a NPM package to solve this called [Tailwind-rn](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/tailwind-rn). So I tried it out and it seemed very easy to work with.

## Using tailwind-rn

Tailwind-rn is a NPM Package written by @[vadimdemedes](https://github.com/vadimdemedes) on Github and published on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-rn). It basically enables you to use tailwind classes inside the style attribute in React Native like so:

```jsx
import tailwind from "tailwind-rn";

const App = () => (
  <SafeAreaView style={tailwind("h-full")}>
    <View style={tailwind("pt-12 items-center")}>
      <View style={tailwind("bg-blue-200 px-3 py-1 rounded-full")}>
        <Text style={tailwind("text-blue-800 font-semibold")}>
          Hello Tailwind
        </Text>
      </View>
    </View>
  </SafeAreaView>
);
```

This of course is very nice and what I wanted. But ofcourse it would be cleaner and easier if you could use a custom `tailwind.config.js` file to configure tailwind in the React Native application. It seems also that is possible with Tailwind-rn, but I haven't played around with it yet, but I'll sure do so soon.

## Building my own template

So, I tought that it could be useful to create a React Native template out of this. Since I looked for it, others must be too.

A React Native template is actually very easy to install and use. Just run

```bash
npx react-native init yourApp --template react-native-template-typescript
```

and it will automatically download the template from NPM (altough installing a template can also be done via `file://`, `https://` or `git://`) and install it on your local machine.

To build my own template, I just downloaded the original template and modified it to use the tailwind-rn package. Configured the `package.json` and `template.config.js` files and published it to NPM.

## Publishing the package

I never published a package to NPM, so there was a bit of a learning curve. But it wasn't that hard once I had setup everything right.

The final packages are available [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-template-tailwind) and the typescript variant is available [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-template-ts-tailwind).

To install my templates you can choose between two variant where one uses typescript and the other doesn't.

For jsx version:

```bash
npx react-native init yourApp --template react-native-template-tailwind
```

For tsx version:

```bash
npx react-native init yourApp --template react-native-template-ts-tailwind
```

Maybe I'll make a template that uses the "more advanced" version of TailwindCSS with a custom `tailwind.config.js` one day.

I hope some people get some value out of the package!

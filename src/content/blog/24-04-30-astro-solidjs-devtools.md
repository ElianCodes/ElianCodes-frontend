# SolidJS Devtools with Astro

I was working on a SolidJS project with Astro and found myself in need of some deeper debugging. That's when I learned of the existence of the [Solid Devtools](https://github.com/thetarnav/solid-devtools) by [Damian Tarnawski](https://github.com/thetarnav) from my friends [Atila](https://atila.io/) and [Daniel](https://www.danieljcafonso.com/). To integrate it into Astro required a couple of small extra steps, so I thought I'd share them with you.

[Here's a link to the quickstart SolidJS Devtools + Astro repo](https://github.com/ElianCodes/astro-solidjs-devtools).

For now, it's only a template to get you started quickly, but I'm definitely exploring options to release it as a an Astro integration somewhere in the future.

## UPDATE: WE DID IT!

I'm happy to announce that the SolidJS Devtools are now integrated into Astro! ðŸŽ‰

Even better, it sparked a whole lot of different devtool integration PRs as well. You can find how to enable the SolidJS Devtools in Astro in [the official Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/solid-js/#devtools).

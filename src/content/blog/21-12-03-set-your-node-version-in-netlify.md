# Set your NodeJS version in Netlify

A couple of times I needed to fix the [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) version on a [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) site, I found myself googling it a couple of times, so this little how-to is basically a note-to-self.

The solution to setting a fixed NodeJS version is actually quite easy:

1. go to your desired website
1. go to Site Settings
1. under _Build & deploy_
1. scroll down to _Environment_
1. add a new environment variable named `NODE_VERSION`
1. set it to your desired version (major or minor)

When you set it to `16`, it will automatically use the latest `16.xx.xx`.

More information over on the [Netlify documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/)

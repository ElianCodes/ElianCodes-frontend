# Releasing my Astro default setup

Every time I set up a new project for myself (using Astro), I find myself installing the same plugins, setting the same settings, and even copy pasting some parts. So I decided to throw it into [a template repo on GitHub](https://github.com/ElianCodes/elians-astro-startkit) and eventually open up the repository to the public, which is what I did today. Not really to get contributed to, but rather to show others how I develop my personal projects.

Link to repo: [elians-astro-startkit](https://github.com/ElianCodes/elians-astro-startkit)

## What does the project contain

You can read the full list of all the technologies I use in the project and why [in the README of the repo](https://github.com/ElianCodes/elians-astro-startkit). But to save you time, here is a TLDR;

- [Astro](https://astro.build)
- [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/)
- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/)
- [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Intentions

I quickly wanted to write down some intentions I have for the repo.

I will update / change it, depending on me changing my "go to" technologies. For instance, at any time in the future, I might change my TypeScript settings or change the design system. Maybe there is an ideal technology that I really want / need but isn't released yet? (Yes, I'm totally talking about Astro Studio).

Feel free to use the template!

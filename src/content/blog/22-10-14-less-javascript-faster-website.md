# Less JavaScript, Faster Website - Astro

14th of October, I gave a lightning talk at [React Brussels](https://www.react.brussels). This blog post contains my slides as well as some extra accompanying speaker notes.

Keep in mind that this was a lightning talk between 4 and 10 minutes long.

## The Slides

Thanks for taking an interest in the slides!

So, I'm Elian, a software engineer at [vBridge](https://www.vbridge.eu) in Belgium üáßüá™.

I‚Äôm also an Ambassador for [Astro](https://astro.build).

![Slide 1](https://i.imgur.com/tyUS0Dp.png)

So what is [Astro](https://astro.build)?

![Slide 2](https://i.imgur.com/Rj5G4c9.jpg)

Astro is a lightning fast framework!

![Slide 3](https://i.imgur.com/G1A9OdB.png)

Even better, it‚Äôs a blazing fast framework!

![Slide 4](https://i.imgur.com/ftYMOuw.jpg)

Or even a primeagen fast framework!

![Slide 5](https://i.imgur.com/8Czu8GZ.png)

Or just simply Astronomically fast!!!

![Slide 6](https://i.imgur.com/ivSCUi2.png)

So; Why was I talking about a different Framework than React at React Brussels?

It's because Astro loves React right!

![Slide 7](https://i.imgur.com/Kz4eG18.png)

Astro is based on an island component design architecture, what does this mean?

![Slide 8](https://i.imgur.com/WXjjnME.jpg)

Well, Astro doesn‚Äôt only love React, it‚Äôs a bring your own framework to the party kinda framework!

![Slide 9](https://i.imgur.com/27LyhTp.jpg)

One of the amazing things about Astro, is that it can be experienced right now in your browser by heading to [astro.new](http://astro.new) & trying it out! Right there in your browser!

You‚Äôll see that we do have templates for all of your favourite frameworks; including React, Preact, Vue, svelte and so on.

![Slide 10](https://i.imgur.com/bt2MTkk.jpg)

Astro also has a lot of official and community driven integrations. All of them are documented and collected on [the Astro website](https://astro.build)!

The React integration is right there on the Astro integrations & Frameworks tab!

Let‚Äôs take a look at using React in Astro in a short demo:

![Slide 11](https://i.imgur.com/CuoMNcy.jpg)

So let‚Äôs pop in our terminal here and set up a new astro project by using our favourite node package manager:

I'll use `yarn create astro`

Astro will ask us what kind of project we‚Äôd like, I‚Äôll choose an empty one, since I want to show of how easy this is.

Astro supports TypeScript, so it will ask us if we want to use that for our project.

That‚Äôs how easy it is to set up a new project with astro

![Slide 12](https://i.imgur.com/P8XhZ0w.jpg)

Let‚Äôs take a closer look at writing and using a React Component in Astro

![Slide 13](https://i.imgur.com/46J8CZk.jpg)

let‚Äôs add a very simple React counter component that you‚Äôve all probably used before. A basic number and two buttons, one decreasing the value and one increasing the value.

Let‚Äôs add some HTML in our `index.astro` file.

Let‚Äôs add some basic styling in the frontmatter of our Astro page, and import our newly created `<Counter />` component in there and add it on the page.

If we now build our Astro project and preview it, We‚Äôll see the imported React Counter component on the page

![Slide 14](https://i.imgur.com/RpMW7Fm.jpg)

Okay, so a lot of this probably feels very familiar for you guys that have used React before, so what‚Äôs the difference?

Astro ships no JavaScript at all by default. Although components might be written in JavaScript or a JavaScript framework.

Of course, if you‚Äôve got no JavaScript, you‚Äôve got no interactivity!

But what if we need to make a component interactive?

![Slide 15](https://i.imgur.com/B48IiTf.jpg)

That is where partial hydration comes in!

![Slide 16](https://i.imgur.com/GDg5Lnh.jpg)

So, probably you are thinking "what the fuck is partial hydration?"

Well, here is the perfect analogy to understand it;

![Slide 17](https://i.imgur.com/sydMRNl.jpg)

If you don‚Äôt water / hydrate a plant enough. The plant will feel very sad

If you hydrate too much; the plant will drown. This is the same for web applications. The application will be drowned in technical debt, bundle size and complexity!

Let‚Äôs take a deeper look into this:

![Slide 18](https://i.imgur.com/vrCYJGl.jpg)

Imagine you have this page. All of those components will require JavaScript to properly render. Even though some of them, like the footer are completely static and don‚Äôt require interactivity.

![Slide 19](https://i.imgur.com/PkO5AfL.jpg)

Actually, you probably want something more like this; Where you just select the components you need to be interactive and ship JavaScript to those components only.

![Slide 20](https://i.imgur.com/wrRNVpD.jpg)

Astro makes this possible by using the `client:` directive.

![Slide 21](https://i.imgur.com/SpfB8ZO.jpg)

Using the client directive, you have complete control over which components should use JavaScript, but also have flexibility to choose when or how the component should become interactive.

![Slide 22](https://i.imgur.com/tuYGjBb.jpg)

There are a couple of options for hydration, let‚Äôs take a look at them!

![Slide 23](https://i.imgur.com/RUyK0E7.jpg)

Firstly there's the `client:load` directive which will just start hydrating the component as soon as the initial DOM content is loaded.

You could also opt for the `client:idle` directive, which will start importing the component JavaScript as soon as the main browser thread is free.

![Slide 24](https://i.imgur.com/zj1iaoP.jpg)

Now let's also take a look at how to use this in our code and what the effect is on our result.

![Slide 25](https://i.imgur.com/k4UYwIw.jpg)

There is also `client:visible` which only will start importing the JavaScript as soon as the component enters the viewport.

Another option is the `client:media` directive which just starts hydrating the component as soon as the given media query requirements are met.

![Slide 26](https://i.imgur.com/nQrN1MQ.jpg)

So let‚Äôs hydrate our component here using `client:visible` and see what that means for our end result.

![Slide 27](https://i.imgur.com/qu0065R.jpg)

Of course, Astro is a lot more than just deciding if we should hydrate a component or not!

![Slide 28](https://i.imgur.com/xYF9WAY.jpg)

Astro also supports:

- Server Side generation
- Server Side Rendering
- File-based routing
- Markdown components
- MDX components / pages
- Deploying to the edge (using tools like Vercel edge functions)
- Deno

But also there are native integrations with popular packages, like Tailwind and Partytown

![Slide 29](https://i.imgur.com/LGA31M1.png)

So, not only is Astro an amazing framework, it's also driven by a beautiful community, so come [chat with us on discord](https://astro.build/chat)!

Here are some more links that can guide you on your journey in Astro!

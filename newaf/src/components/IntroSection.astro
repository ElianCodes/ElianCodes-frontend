    Software Engineer @vBridge by day 🧑‍💻<br />
    Blogger & web enthusiast by night (while also trying to be a good boyfriend 🍷).

    My 💖 for the web was first sparked in 2016 when I decided to build a simple website to display the photo's I took at the time, there was no way back! I'm mainly focused on front-end development, but still a full-stack developer at heart (I just love to fiddle with everything I guess).

    In 2020 I discovered cloud and serverless development, that really peeked my interest further and made me the curious developer I am today.
